## 🌐 Client Access & API Gateway

**All external access goes through the nginx gateway on port 80:**

### Gateway Routes
```
http://localhost/api/user/     → User Service (auth, profiles)
http://localhost/api/event/    → Event Service (events, venues)
http://localhost/api/search/   → Search Service (event search)
http://localhost/api/booking/  → Booking Service (reservations)
http://localhost/health        → Gateway health check
```

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// All requests go through the gateway
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost'; // or your domain

// Login user
fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/user/auth/login`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({email: 'atlanuser1@mail.com', password: '11111111'})
});

// Search events
fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/search/search?q=diwali`);

// Book tickets
fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/booking/reserve`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({event_id: 'EVENT_ID', quantity: 2})
});
```

## 🧪 Test Data (Auto-Created)

**Test Users:**
- `atlanuser1@mail.com` / `11111111`
- `atlanuser2@mail.com` / `11111111`

**Admin:**
- `atlanadmin@mail.com` / `11111111`

**Events:** 10 diverse events (Diwali Festival, Tech Summit, Music Concert, etc.)

## 🛠️ Development Setup

This project is managed with `make` and `docker-compose`. Ensure you have Docker, Go, and `make` installed.

1.  **Initial Setup (One-Time)**:
    This command starts the required infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch), runs database migrations, starts all services in the background, and seeds the database with initial data.

    ```bash
    make dev-setup-full
    ```

2.  **Stop Everything**:
    To stop all running services and shut down the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    make kill-services
    make docker-down
    ```

For a full list of commands (e.g., running individual services, managing migrations), see `make help`.

## ⚙️ Architectural Flow & Service Roles

Evently's architecture is designed for separation of concerns, ensuring that each microservice has a distinct and clear responsibility.

-   **User Service**: This is the gateway for user authentication. It handles registration and login, issuing JWT access and refresh tokens to provide a seamless and secure user session.

-   **Event Service**: This service is the **single source of truth** for all event and venue data. It manages creation, updates, and availability. To optimize for performance, write operations are handled here, while read-intensive search queries are offloaded to a dedicated search engine.

-   **Search Service**: For a fast user experience, all event data is indexed in **Elasticsearch**. This allows for complex filtering, geo-spatial queries, and full-text search without putting a heavy load on the primary database. When an event is created or updated in the Event Service, it makes a direct, synchronous API call to the Search Service to ensure the search index is immediately updated.

-   **Booking Service**: This is the core transactional engine of the platform. It orchestrates the entire booking process, from reserving tickets and processing payments to managing cancellations and user booking history.

## 🧠 Architectural Challenges & Solutions

#### Concurrency: The Race to Zero Seats

This is the most critical challenge in a ticketing system. When thousands of users attempt to book the last few available seats simultaneously, the system must prevent overselling without deadlocking. Evently solves this with a multi-layered approach:

1.  **Optimistic Locking**: The `events` table has a `version` column. When a user tries to book a ticket, the service reads the event's current version number. The request to update the seat count will only succeed if the version in the database is the same as the one the service read. If another user's request was processed first, the version number will have changed, causing the second request to fail safely. The user is then prompted to try again.

2.  **Atomic Operations**: The SQL query to update the seat count is an atomic `UPDATE ... SET available_seats = available_seats - ? WHERE version = ?` operation, ensuring that checking the version and decrementing the seat count happen as a single, indivisible step.

Here is a diagram illustrating the flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User A
    participant User B
    participant BookingService
    participant EventService
    participant Database

    Note over User A, User B: Both see 1 seat left (version: 5)
    
    User A->>+BookingService: Reserve 1 seat (for event v5)
    User B->>+BookingService: Reserve 1 seat (for event v5)

    BookingService->>+EventService: Update seats for event v5
    EventService->>+Database: UPDATE events SET seats=0, version=6 WHERE version=5
    Database-->>-EventService: Success (1 row updated)
    EventService-->>-BookingService: Reservation successful!
    BookingService-->>-User A: Your seat is reserved.

    BookingService->>+EventService: Update seats for event v5
    EventService->>+Database: UPDATE events SET seats=..., version=... WHERE version=5
    Database-->>-EventService: Failure (0 rows updated, version is now 6)
    EventService-->>-BookingService: Version conflict error!
    BookingService-->>-User B: Sorry, seats were just taken. Please try again.
```

#### The Two-Phase Booking Flow

To prevent users from holding tickets indefinitely without paying, Evently uses a two-phase system powered by Redis.

1.  **Phase 1: Reservation**: When a user initiates a booking, the Booking Service makes an internal call to the Event Service to secure the seats using the optimistic locking mechanism described above. Upon success, it creates a temporary reservation document in a **Redis cluster** with a 5-minute Time-To-Live (TTL).
2.  **Phase 2: Confirmation**: The user has 5 minutes to complete the payment. If the payment is successful within the time limit, the reservation is converted into a permanent booking in the PostgreSQL database, the temporary record in Redis is deleted, and the user's ticket history is updated. If the user fails to pay, the Redis key expires automatically, and a background job returns the seats to the available pool.

#### Waitlist Management

When an event sells out, users can join a waitlist. This waitlist is managed efficiently as a sorted set in **Redis**, with each user's entry timestamp acting as their score for prioritization. If a booking is cancelled, a background worker is triggered. Instead of returning the seats to the general pool, it retrieves the user at the top of the waitlist, removes them from the queue, and offers them an exclusive, short-term window (e.g., 10 minutes) to purchase the newly available tickets, ensuring a fair process for dedicated fans.

## 📦 Infrastructure Containers

-   **PostgreSQL**: The primary relational database used for persistent storage of users, events, and bookings. Each service connects to its own isolated database (`users_db`, `events_db`, `bookings_db`) to maintain service independence.
-   **Redis**: An in-memory data store used for high-speed operations. Its primary roles are caching frequently accessed data (like event availability) and temporarily storing booking reservations during the 5-minute payment window.
-   **Elasticsearch**: A powerful search engine that indexes event data. It enables fast, complex queries (full-text, geospatial, faceted search) that would be inefficient to perform on a relational database.
